For example, if a high proportion of users cant beat level 1 in our game, we need to make it easier. Such data can also help us improve artwork in the game (by knowing what styles are most popular), or help us determine default option settings.

Clone this wiki locally Clone in Desktop Android / Barcode Scanner Why does Barcode Scanner request permission to access ...,0
"... my contacts? QR Codes and Data Matrix codes can encode contact information. Upon scanning such a code, you will be prompted to add the contact information to your contacts list. In addition, Barcode Scanner can encode a contact as a QR Code and present it on-screen, so that a friend can point their phone at your screen to transfer that contact. This is why the app requests permission to write and read contacts. They are not used in any other way.",1
"... my browser history and bookmarks? Just like contacts, you can share a bookmark with a friend by encoding the URL as a QR Code. It is then shown on screen for him or her to scan with their phone. That's the only thing we use them for.",1
"... my SD card? You can use Barcode Scanner to email a generated QR code or your scan history. To do this, the barcode image / history CSV file must first be written to device storage, which is why the permission is needed. As a bonus, this makes this output available for retrieval from your SD card directly. It is not used for any other purpose.",2
"... my wi-fi settings? QR codes can encode the user name, password, etc. for a wi-fi network so that you don't have to type them into your phone. To do this, the application needs to be able to change wi-fi settings.",0
"It doesn't focus or scan on my phone Most reports of things like this are unfortunately traceable to camera driver problems. This can be true even if other apps like the camera work. The problem is of the form: Barcode Scanner app asks device if it supports feature X Devices reports it supports X Barcode Scanner requests feature X Camera driver does not support it correctly, and fails to initialize All initialization including light, focus and other settings fail, making scanning hard or impossible",0
"First, try disabling camera features in Settings. Look for ""Device Bug Workarounds"". Usually, disabling one or more of these will work around the issue.",0
"If not, only report an issue like this on the mailing list if you can also supply log output from the app using",0
"adb logcat or the aLogcat app. Find log messages from the time the app first opens, especially including any apparent exceptions or error messages. This is useful information even if it does not lead to a workaround. Ideally, provide a proposed code change.",0
Barcode Scanner sets off a virus warning The Barcode Scanner app contains no viruses or malware.,0
"To ensure you get the official copy from this project, only download Barcode Scanner from Google Play.",0
"This is built and signed by us, and Google Play uses these signatures to verify that the copy you get is from us. Other app stores, including Amazon, may have a copy of the Barcode Scanner app, but these are not built or maintained by us.",0
"Worse still, because this is an open source project, it's easy for a malicious person to add viruses or malware, build and distributed a look-alike copy. For this reason, don't obtain copies from third-party app stores.",0
"Can we distribute Barcode Scanner, or pre-install it on our Android devices?",0
"Yes. The application is distributed under the terms of the Apache License 2.0. Distributing the .apk files released by this project complies with the terms of the license, with no further action required. There is no fee. These are the only available license terms.",0
"We strongly recommend distributing the project's release, rather than building from source, for best user experience. It is signed with the project's keys and so is the only copy that will be upgradeable to future releases via Google Play.",0
The project only maintains a release of Barcode Scanner on Google Play and does not maintain releases elsewhere. Other app stores are however welcome to maintain releases on their own.,0
"Can we talk about monetizing Barcode Scanner using our ad network, or paid promotion?",0
"The app has always been ad-free and has not been monetized, and will continue to be so. Barcode Scanner will not run ads or otherwise monetize. It is the work of many owners and would be difficult to fairly allocate revenue. It is open source and could be built without ads easily anyway.",0
As a result there is no interest in advertising or paying to promote the app either.,0
"I don't get prices from Barcode Scanner, or get very high prices, for some products",0
"This application does not maintain or provide any product information, so these are not problems with Barcode Scanner itself. It links to Google Product Search and Web Search; contact Google with suggestions.",0
"Note that common household items are often available for purchase online, but in bulk quantity. This is one reason that results for the product's price seem high: they are not for individual items. Again, this is not an issue with Barcode Scanner itself.",0
"The app won't download or install These are functions of Google Play, and outside the application's control. We do get some reports of stuck downloads which can be fixed by rebooting the phone. If that doesn't help, please contact the phone manufacturer or your carrier.",0
"I can't uninstall the Barcode Scanner application Some manufacturers put Barcode Scanner into the ""firmware"" of the phone, which means it is not uninstallable. This is an issue to take up with manufacturers or carriers. Sorry, we can't do anything about this.",0
"Does Barcode Scanner send messages to my contacts? No, absolutely not. I have seen reports of user's contacts receiving messages like: I've been using Barcode Scanner and I think you might like it. Check it out from your Android phone: http://market.android.com/search?q=pname:com.google.zxing.client.android *Note: Tap the Market icon in the Complete action screen that appears after you tap the link above.",0
"These are not sent by Barcode Scanner. In fact, you can see instances of this message pertaining to many other applications by searching Google.",0

"d) Cookies or similar technologies: A cookie is a small text file or piece of data that is downloaded to and stored on your computer or device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes the cookie. As part of BlackBerry's Offerings, BlackBerry may use different types of cookies or similar technologies (""Cookies"") from time to time. Certain Cookies are necessary to facilitate your use of BlackBerry Offerings (such as when you use a shopping basket) or to protect both you and BlackBerry when you sign-in to certain services (such as storing your credentials to make it easier whenever you want to use BlackBerry Offerings or to confirm that you are logged in). Other Cookies are more performance-related such as for analytics or contextual purposes to help us understand how users engage with BlackBerry Offerings so we can provide new and enhanced BlackBerry Offerings (such as which pages or features are most popular). Some Cookies are more function-related and help personalize your experience and make BlackBerry Offerings easier to use (such as your language or jurisdiction preferences), or to help BlackBerry display personalized content to you. Other Cookies or similar technologies may be used for targeted advertising purposes (e.g. certain BlackBerry Offerings may be supported by advertising revenue and display advertisements and promotions which may be targeted against non-personally identifiable attributes or aggregate data collected by BlackBerry, and BlackBerry or our service providers may place such advertising on BlackBerry Offerings).

"c) Marketing communications from BlackBerry BlackBerry may communicate with you by a variety of means, such as using the email address(es) that you associate to your BlackBerry device or your unique device identifier (e.g. PIN). BlackBerry may communicate information, surveys, marketing materials, advertisements or customized content which has been personalized to try to make it more relevant to you as part of your existing business relationship with BlackBerry. For example, we may do so where you have not unsubscribed from receiving such communications and it is permitted by law, where you have explicitly agreed to receive such communications, where you use free services which rely upon advertising (including targeted advertising based on profile information), or through utilizing aggregated data or data that has been made anonymous. BlackBerry may ask you from time to time if you would like to receive from BlackBerry or authorized third parties selected by BlackBerry additional announcements, news, offers or event invitations regarding BlackBerry and BlackBerry Offerings. You may also choose to provide BlackBerry with information in response to various BlackBerry promotions. If you agree to participate in contests, surveys, giveaways, reviews, or other promotions that BlackBerry sponsors or co-sponsors, please ensure that you read the Notice that may be associated with these initiatives in order to obtain further details about how your personal information will be managed.

Because such service-related communications are important to your use of BlackBerry Offerings, you may not opt-out of receiving these communications.",0

"In certain situations where you purchase or use a Third Party Offering (e.g. paid content subscription service, downloaded application), BlackBerry may share certain information with the third party for purposes of providing you with the product, service or software and your information will then be subject to the third party's privacy policy. We encourage all our users to learn about the privacy practices of such third parties before agreeing to purchase or obtain their products, services or software.",4
"BlackBerry uses contractual or other means to provide a comparable level of protection while the information is being processed by our service providers. It is BlackBerry's policy to enter into confidentiality obligations with any third party that obtains confidential information including personal information from BlackBerry. For example, except where BlackBerry is required or permitted by law to disclose personal information, our service providers to whom we provide your personal information typically agree to hold the information in confidence and only use the information for the purposes for which it was provided or to comply with applicable laws.",0
"In the event of the sale of all or a portion of BlackBerry's assets, BlackBerry may provide personal information to the third party purchaser.",4

"f) Third Party Offerings BlackBerry does not own or operate all the applications or services that you download and use on your device or through other BlackBerry Offerings. When you download or utilize Third Party Offerings, personal information from your device or other BlackBerry Offerings may be accessed by such third parties. For example, a Third Party Offering might access on-device data such as contacts, calendar entries, email, location-based information, or it may access or share files or data stored on the device (including with additional Third Party Offerings). You should review the privacy policies and any agreements with such third parties to understand how your personal information will be treated by those entities, as BlackBerry is not responsible for your dealings with third parties or their applications, products, services or software. BlackBerry does not directly control how such third parties process any personal information they collect in connection with the Third Party Offerings you use.",0
"In some cases, you may adjust the permissions granted to Third Party Offerings. You should periodically review these permissions including default permissions, as well as the Options or Settings menu on your device, in order to learn more about its security and available controls.",0
"top 6. Accuracy of your personal information BlackBerry takes reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is sufficiently accurate, complete and up-to-date. BlackBerry also depends on you to update or correct your personal information whenever necessary.",0
"top 7. Safeguarding your personal information BlackBerry continues to evolve our physical, organizational and technological measures used to protect your personal information against loss or theft, unauthorized access, alteration or disclosure appropriate to its level of sensitivity. For example, if a BlackBerry website requests your name and password, it will have a variety of security measures in place that are designed to protect against the loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration of the personal information submitted to BlackBerry. Through BlackBerry's Code of Business Standards and Principles, BlackBerry employees are made aware of the importance of appropriately and securely handling personal information, to keep it in secure locations and systems, and to limit access to personal information to those with a need to know it for business reasons.",0
"In addition, certain BlackBerry systems and processes are externally certified on a regular basis (e.g. certification to ISO/IEC 27001:2005 Information Security Management System standard).",0
"a) Your obligations to safeguard your personal information You also have an obligation to safeguard your personal information. You can reduce risk of unauthorized access to your personal information by using common sense security practices. For example, you are responsible for utilizing appropriate security measures to control access to your device and computer system, such as creating a strong password that cannot be easily guessed by others (e.g. by including punctuation marks, numbers, capital and lowercase letters, and choosing a password of an appropriate length and which does not include your name or account name), using different passwords for different services and using up-to-date antivirus software.",0
"As noted above, in some cases, you may adjust the permissions granted to Third Party Offerings. You should periodically review these permissions including default permissions, as well as the Options or Settings menu on your device, in order to learn more about its security and available controls.",0
"If you return, sell, discard, or transfer your device or other BlackBerry product to another person or entity (such as providing your device to BlackBerry or another entity for repair, refurbishment or replacement), you should ensure that the device and any associated accessories and peripherals are removed or securely wiped of any personal information or other sensitive data they might contain (e.g. SIM cards, microSD cards). You should also disassociate your device from all email accounts and other data services so that email and data are no longer directed to the device (e.g. push services, emails delivered through the BlackBerry Internet Service, remote backup). Otherwise, your personal information may be available to a subsequent user of the device, and you may incur subscription and network data charges. You may learn more about how to take steps to protect yourself through the Options or Settings menu on your device, searching support articles online at www.blackberry.com, or by contacting your airtime service provider.",5
"top 8. BlackBerry's ongoing efforts to be transparent BlackBerry continues to make available information to help our users better understand BlackBerry's processing of personal information and how to exercise choices regarding the use of your personal information through various channels including this Privacy Policy, applicable Notices and additional information that may be made available from time to time on various BlackBerry websites or on your device.",0
"top 9. You can access your personal information Upon written request, BlackBerry will inform you whether or not it holds personal information about you and provide you with access to your information within a reasonable timeframe and at minimal or no cost in accordance with applicable laws. If you identify an inaccuracy or incompleteness in your personal information, BlackBerry will amend your information and notify any third parties as required by applicable laws.",0
"In certain situations and depending on applicable laws, BlackBerry may not be able to provide access to all of the personal information that it holds about you. For example, BlackBerry may not provide access to information if doing so: would likely reveal personal information about a third party; could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of another individual; would reveal BlackBerry or third party confidential information; includes information that is protected by solicitor or attorney client privilege; or includes information that was processed in relation to the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a law.",0
"In order to safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access, BlackBerry may ask that you provide sufficient information to identify yourself prior to providing access to your personal information.",0
"Depending on the circumstances and applicable laws, BlackBerry may refuse to process certain access requests (e.g. access requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, would be extremely impractical or require disproportionate technical effort).",0
"top 10. Questions or concerns? How to contact us BlackBerry welcomes your questions or comments regarding this Privacy Policy and the way we process your personal information.

The term ""Services"", as used in this Privacy Policy, references both the Maple Media website (""the Site"") and the Maple Media applications (""the Application(s)""). This Privacy Policy applies to information that you provide to us (or permit third party sites to provide us) or that we collect through the Services. This Privacy Policy will be updated at dates in the future to be determined by Maple Media LLC. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Services. Maple Media recommends that you consult this policy periodically for any changes.",0
"By using our Services you are consenting to our Processing of your information as described in this Privacy Policy now and as revised in the future by Maple Media LLC. ""Processing"" means using cookies on a computer or using, reviewing, or otherwise interacting with information in any way, including, but not limited to, storing, deleting, collecting, using, combining and disclosing information and transferring it to US and other governments.",1
"Information Collection and Use: Personally Identifiable Information As you use the Services, you may provide us with personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to identify, track, or contact you (""Personal Information""). Personal Information includes data such as your name and email address, but is not limited to this information. We use your Personal Information generally to provide our Services and administer your inquiries.",2
"You may sign-up to use the Services directly via the Site or Application or via certain third party social networking sites (each, a ""Social Networking Site""). If you decide to create an account to use the Services via a Social Networking Site, we may extract the personal information you have provided to such Social Networking Site (such as your ""real"" name, email address and other information you make available via the Social Networking Site) from the account you have with such Social Networking Site and use that information to create your Maple Media account, or an account for a Maple Media application, website, or property; the information we extract may depend on the privacy settings you have with the Social Networking Site.",1
"If you choose to purchase any virtual goods as part of your use of the Services, to the extent available, we or our third party service providers may collect Personal Information from you to facilitate your payment for such virtual goods.",0
"We also collect other information that you provide in connection with your registration and/or use of the Services (e.g., without limitation, birthday, gender, zip code (on its own), individual preferences and certain information about your computer or mobile device, such as operating system, software version and unique advertising identifier) (""Non-Identifying Information"").",1
"Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences).",0
"We also use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) to contact you with newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your ""user preferences"" information. (See ""Changing or Deleting Information,"" below.)",2
"Log Data. When you use the Services, whether as a registered user or a non-registered user, for example in accessing our Services through a Social Networking Site, (any of these, a ""Maple Media User""), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (""Log Data""). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol (""IP"") address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to the Service, pages of the websites involved in the Service that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Services and for the Service's technical administration, to increase the functionality and user-friendliness of our Services, and to better tailor the Services to our visitors' needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you use our Services again, it will recognize you and serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests, as described in more detail below. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Service meet the criteria required to process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.",2
"Cookies Like many websites, our Service uses ""cookies"" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any Personal Information you submit while using our Services.",2
"We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Services in order to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor aggregate usage by Maple Media Website Users and web traffic routing. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Services and then close your browser.",2
"We may participate in behavioral-based advertising. This means that a third party may place a cookie on your browser, or use a web beacon, to collect information about your use of our website so that they can provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interest. That advertising may appear either on our website, or on other websites. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. On mobile you can reset your settings by taking the following steps (for iOS: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074 and for Android: https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en).

"Information Sharing and Disclosure Maple Media Registered Users. If you register through the Services on the Site and submit your Personal Information to create a profile webpage, for Maple Media or for any Maple Media applications, websites, or services, other registered users will see your ""User Name"" (""Subscriber Identifier""). You can choose what other Personal Information you provide as part of your profile (""Other Subscriber Information"") and in some cases you can choose whether to share that information publicly on through the Services by making selections via the ""user preferences"" section of your profile webpage.",4
"Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information; Advertisers. We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes.",4
"In particular, we may decide to share Non-Identifying Information (including the advertising identifier currently associated with your device) and Log Data and other aggregated information with advertisers. Such information may be used to send you advertisements for products and services that are relevant to your interests.",4
"For example, we may collect and share the advertising identifier associated with your device (such as the Apple IDFA and Android Advertising ID) with advertisers. An advertising identifier is an alphanumeric string that can be used to identify your device so that advertisers can serve relevant ads to you. We use the Apple IDFA only as permitted by Apple, and we use the Android Advertising ID only as permitted by Google. An advertising identifier is assigned, and ad tracking is turned on, by default on your mobile device. You may limit the use of or reset your advertising device ID using the privacy settings on your mobile device; in some instances you may need to reset the operating system to reset the advertising device ID. We do not associate any of your personal information with your advertising device ID without your consent (which may be given by you in our terms of use for an Application).",4
"Service Providers.

These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.",2
Social Networking Sites. We may share the information in your Maple Media account profiles and the account profiles of Maple Media applications and websites (including your Personal Information) with the Social Networking Sites you have linked to your Maple Media accounts to provide you with enhanced services.

"Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. Maple Media cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Maple Media or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.",0
"Business Transfers. Maple Media may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.",0
"Changing or Deleting Your Information All registered Maple Media users, or registered users of a Maple Media application or website, may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile by contacting us. If you completely delete all such information, then your account may become deactivated. If you would like us to delete your record in our system, please contact us and we will attempt to accommodate your request if we do not have any legal obligation to retain the record. See below for privacy contact information.",0
"Security Maple Media is concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to help protect your information from unauthorized access. No security, however, can eliminate the possibility that your information may be accessed by an unauthorized third party and we cannot guarantee that your information will remain secure in all situations.",0
"We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored ""personal data"" (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email, mail, telephone, or conspicuous posting on our website in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system. We reserve the right to choose which method we use to contact you about such an event.",0
"International Transfer Your information may be transferred to - and maintained on - computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Maple Media transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.",4
"Our Policy Toward Children These Services are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at team@maplemedia.io. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.",5
"Phishing Identity theft and the practice currently known as ""phishing"" are of great concern to Maple Media. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission's website.",1
"Links to Other Sites Our Services may provide links to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by ""clicking on"" a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party's website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.",2

"Example ""legal process or enforceable governmental request"" Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to hand over user data. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when the requests appear to be overly broad or don't follow the correct process.",0
"Example ""limit sharing or visibility settings"" For example, you can choose your settings so your name and photo do not appear in an ad.",0
"Example ""linked with information about visits to multiple sites"" Google Analytics is based on first-party cookies. Data generated through Google Analytics can be linked, by the Google Analytics customer or by Google, using Google technology, to third-party cookies, related to visits to other websites, for instance when an advertiser wants to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.",2

"Example ""protect Google and our users"" For example, if you're concerned about unauthorized access to your email, ""Last account activity"" in Gmail shows you information about recent activity in your email, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, as well as the time and date.",3
"Example ""protect"" For example, one reason we collect and analyze IP addresses and cookies is to protect our services against automated abuse.",3
"Example ""provide"" For example, the IP address assigned to your device is used to send the data you requested back to your device.",3
"Example ""sharing"" For example, with Google+, you have many different sharing options.",4
"Example ""sharing with others quicker and easier"" For example, if someone is already a contact, Google will autocomplete their name if you want to add them to a message in Gmail.",4
"Example ""the people who matter most to you online"" For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of a message you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses from your Contacts list.",0
"Example ""to make it easier to share things with people you know""",0
"For example, if you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name.",0
"Example ""view and interact with our ads"" For example, we regularly report to advertisers on whether we served their ad to a page and whether that ad was likely to be seen by users (as opposed to, for example, being on part of the page to which users did not scroll).",0
"Example ""We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly"" When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide very useful information about particular trends at that time.",4
"Example ""Wi-Fi access points and cell towers"" For example, Google can approximate your device's location based on the known location of nearby cell towers.",3

"Example ""to show trends"" You can see some of these at Google Trends and YouTube Trending Videos.",0
"Example ""your activity on other sites and apps"" This activity might come from your use of Google products like Chrome Sync or from your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics). These products share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your account settings and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.",1

"About privacy on Google Play Books December 16, 2015 | View archived version The main Google Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal information when you use Google's products and services, including Google Play. Below, we describe privacy practices specific to books on Google Play.",0
"Practices specific to Google Play Books The privacy practices that are specific to books on Google Play are: To fulfill contractual commitments to rightsholders who license us books, we enforce certain security limits (for example, to prevent abusive sharing of purchased books and to enforce page view limits on some book previews), and we also enforce limits on the numbers of browsers or devices that can access an account during a given period of time. In order to enforce limits on numbers of devices, we will store the unique ID numbers of your devices on our servers. You can delete a device ID number when you wish to stop using that device.",2
"You will need to have a Google Account in order to purchase books because account information is necessary to provide access to users who bought the book. We limit the information (such as books titles) we provide to credit card companies, and enable you to delete purchased books from your Google Account. However, you will not be able to delete the record of your purchase transaction (including the title of the book) from your Google Payments account history.",1
"If you are part of a family group on Google Play and purchase books using a family payment method, your family manager will be responsible for these purchases and will therefore see a record of your books purchases made using the family payment method, including titles and genres. Although you will be able to delete purchased books from your Google Account, you will not be able to delete the family manager's records of the purchase transactions.",0
"In order to enable consistent reading position across devices and provide useful navigation within a book, we store the last five pages (only) in each book a user has viewed with the user's account. We also store pages viewed for security monitoring and/or if the user elects to use the Web History service.",2
"Special legal privacy protections for users may apply in cases where law enforcement or civil litigants ask Google for information about what books an individual user has looked at. Some jurisdictions have special ""books laws"" saying that this information is not available unless the person asking for it meets a special, high standard such as proving to a court that there is a compelling need for the information, and that this need outweighs the reader's interest in reading anonymously under the United States First Amendment or other applicable laws. Where these ""books laws"" exist and apply to books on Google Play, we will raise them. We will also continue our strong history of fighting for high standards to protect users, regardless of whether a particular ""books law"" applies. In addition, we are committed to notifying the affected user if we receive such a request that may lead to disclosure of their information; if we are permitted to do so by law and if we have an effective way to contact the user, we will seek to do so in time for the user to challenge the request.",0
"For additional information about books on Google Play and privacy, please see our FAQ.",0

"AMT Games (IE MELET) Privacy Policy AMT Games is officially registered in different countries and can be legally represented by either: IE MELET, a Russian individual enterpreneur with a principal place of business at 12th Line of Vasilievskii Island, 199178 Saint-Petersburg, Russia, Reg#: 312784711100572, Tax#: 780160616253 10K MMR ltd., a company incorporated under the laws of Seychelles and having its registered office at Oliaji Trade Centre -1st Floor, Victoria, Mahe, #reg 194661",0
"AMT Games is reffered to in this privacy policy as ""Developer""",0
"Developer is committed to making our games both fun and safe to use and adheres to best practices regarding the collection and use of both anonymous and limited personal information. In general, our approach is to collect anonymous data wherever possible and use as little personal information as is necessary to provide the best games and services, and then only to use personal information to make those games and services better.",0
"This privacy policy applies to the Developer's website located at //amt-games.com, the related game and game editor sites, and to Developer-published Facebook and mobile applications. Keep in mind that not all games and applications created by Developer use personal information or have advertising components - this privacy policy explicitly relates to the website elements, games, applications, and services that do collect privacy-related information.",0
"This privacy policy may change to reflect changes in business practice, legislation, or market reality. Any changes will be posted here, and significant changes will either be broadcast on the Developer's blog or via email.",0
"Types of Information Developer Login Registration: When you register for a Developer account directly, you provide us with optional information including email, age, gender, and country. This information is not required - we provide our services to you without it, but taken as a whole this gives us a better understanding of our players and community and helps us make better game design decisions. As you might imagine, men and women play differently, as do younger and older players, so it is helpful to see trends based on these demographics to help make games that all players enjoy. We use emails to keep members up to date on news, releases, and updates, and you may opt out of these emails at any point. Children under 13 are allowed to register for Developer accounts, but they may not enter any personally identifiable information. If children under 13 want to receive such news emails, they must use a parent or guardian's email.",1
"Developer Forum Registration: If you register for Developer forums, we require an email address for registration validation and communication purposes. You may opt out of these communications at any point. Children under 13 are not allowed to register for the Developer forums.",0
"Facebook, Google+, Game Center, Game Circle and Google Play Logins: We use these services to connect players to their friends for co-operative and competitive play, and to compare scores and progress. We use the respective platform standard versions of these services and only reference the username/email associated to associate with your saved data, scores, and game progress.",0
"Game and Site Data: Developer tracks information about the way visitors and players use our web sites and games so that we can make our sites and games more accessible, pertinent, and fun. Developer uses log files to store information such as internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring, exit and visited pages, platform used, date/time stamp, track user's movement in the whole, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc, are not linked to personally identifiable information. Developer uses cookies, server stored game data, and third-party analytics services to track player activity and make games more awesome. You can set your browser to limit or reject cookies, but this has a high chance of interfering with site and game features and may prevent some games from playing at all or saving your progress",1
"Advertising: Developer uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when visiting our web pages. We offer our web games for free, so these ads allow us to continue providing top quality games. The third-party advertising companies may collect and use information (but not your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. We do not have access to this information or influence over their policies, barring our ability to discontinue their services. If you would like more information about advertising practices and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, you can visit Google's Advertising and Privacy page or the Network Advertising Initiative. Please understand that if you disable or block certain ad features, then other aspects of the site may not work correctly.",0
"Facebook Information: When you register for Developer using Facebook, use Facebook likes, or share links through Facebook Connect, Developer accesses data already provided to Facebook in accordance with their Privacy Policy, and is only granted access to that information via the permissions necessary to use the games or services. Developer reviews Facebook data such as age, location, and gender along with various game and social data about how you are playing a game or using the web site in order to make our games and site more awesome. This information may be stored in cookies on your computer. Developer does not share or sell this information with any party.",0
"Billing and Financial: Developer does track purchases made using Xsolla, Facebook Credits, Super Rewards, Trial Pay, and/or other 3rd party wallet services, but Developer does not have access to any personal billing information; purchases are tracked for purposes of making sure that Developer deliver great value for money and so that we can provide awesome customer support should something go wrong.",0
"Other Use of Information Developer does not sell, rent, or publicly share your personally identifiable information to anyone. We may use the information you provide to provide customer support or respond to forum posts. We may share tools to access information to our development or technology partners, but this will be done under standard terms of nondisclosure. In the event of a change in corporate ownership or control, we would then transfer all personally-identifiable and non-personally identifiable information to the new owner or controlling party. Developer would also share the limited personal information to comply with court order, fraud protection, or other legal proceedings, to enforce our Terms of Service, or to protect the safety, rights, or property of Developer or its employees.",4
"Children Under 13 We respect the privacy of parents, guardians, and their children, and we are committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Children under 13 may not enter personally identifiable information during the registration process (they must use a parent's or guardian's email address), and they may not sign up for forum accounts at all. Please be aware that Epic War TD and Battle for the Galaxy allow text chat to coordinate and enhance the multiplayer experiences. Children under 13 should never give out personal information in these chats, and Developer representatives will never ask for personal information. If anyone ever asks for personal information in chat, please screenshot the interaction and send the image to support@amt-games.com for investigation. If at any time a parent or guardian believes that his or her child has submitted personal information to us, he or she can contact us at support@amt-games.com. Developer will make reasonable efforts to delete the information upon learning that it relates to a child under the age of 13. Developer believes that parents should supervise their children's online activities and actively advise them on appropriate behavior and online safety, including avoiding chat systems and other 3rd party open communication tools.",0
In-App Purchasing Some of our games provide additional content for a direct fee - usually buying an item or an amount of in-game currency to make gameplay faster or more fun. Parents and guardians should be aware that they can set up their mobile devices to disallow one touch purchases and enforce password entry before any real-dollar purchase. Parents and guardians are responsible for maintaining password security for these systems and in general should not share passwords with their children. The following links describe how to make sure purchase verification is in place: //support.google.com/googleplay/answer/1626831?hl=en-GB http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201112050 http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4009,0

Nevertheless, we only want to be working with partners who exercise best practices, so if you ever have concerns about third parties, you may contact us at support@amt-games.com so that we can review our relationship with them.",0

"Additional Options and Questions If you do not agree with this privacy policy, you may still use most of our website features and games without registering at all, or you have the option to register without sharing any personally identifiable information. If we do not have a valid email for you, however, it may limit or completely prevent us from providing fast or effective customer support.
