Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics). These products share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your account settings and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.We keep your personal information private and safe - and put you in control."

In addition, we may replace past names associated with your Google Account so that you are represented consistently across all our services. If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Profile information, such as your name and photo.We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. One of the products we use to do this on our own services is Google Analytics. For example, by saving your language preferences, we'll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate an identifier from cookies or similar technologies with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Google services - for example to make it easier to share things with people you know.

For example, you can: Review and update your Google activity controls to decide what types of data, such as videos you've watched on YouTube or past searches, you would like saved with your account when you use Google services. You can also visit these controls to manage whether certain activity is stored in a cookie or similar technology on your device when you use our services while signed-out of your account.

Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.With domain administrators If your Google Account is managed for you by a domain administrator (for example, for G Suite users) then your domain administrator and resellers who provide user support to your organization will have access to your Google Account information (including your email and other data).

In particular: We encrypt many of our services using SSL. We offer you two step verification when you access your Google Account, and a Safe Browsing feature in Google Chrome. We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems. We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.Example ""access to your personal information"" For example, with Google Dashboard you can quickly and easily see some of the data associated with your Google Account.For example, when you're signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with pages, photos, and Google+ posts from your friends and people who know you or follow you on Google+ may see your posts and profile in their results.Example ""connect with people"" For example, you could get suggestions of people you might know or want to connect with on Google+, based on the connections you have with people on other Google products, like Gmail; and people who have a connection with you may see your profile as a suggestion.Example ""improve your user experience"" For example, cookies allow us to analyse how users interact with our services.Example ""linked with information about visits to multiple sites"" Google Analytics is based on first-party cookies. Data generated through Google Analytics can be linked, by the Google Analytics customer or by Google, using Google technology, to third-party cookies, related to visits to other websites, for instance when an advertiser wants to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.Example ""may not function properly"" For example, we use a cookie called 'lbcs' which makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser."
49,3,"Location information When you use Google services, we may collect and process information about your actual location. We use various technologies to determine location, including IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide Google with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.Example ""and other sensors"" Your device may have sensors that provide information to assist in a better understanding of your location. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine things like speed, or a gyroscope to figure out direction of travel.Example ""may collect and process information about your actual location"" For example, Google Maps can center the maps view on your current location.Example ""protect Google and our users"" For example, if you're concerned about unauthorized access to your email, ""Last account activity"" in Gmail shows you information about recent activity in your email, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, as well as the time and date.Example ""protect"" For example, one reason we collect and analyze IP addresses and cookies is to protect our services against automated abuse.Example ""provide"" For example, the IP address assigned to your device is used to send the data you requested back to your device.Example ""Wi-Fi access points and cell towers"" For example, Google can approximate your device's location based on the known location of nearby cell towers."
49,4,"Unique application numbers Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Google when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.If you have a Google Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Google or on third-party applications connected to your Google Account (such as +1's, reviews you write and comments you post) in our services, including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to limit sharing or visibility settings in your Google Account.We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners - like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.Example ""and our partners"" We allow trusted businesses to use cookies or similar technologies for advertising and research purposes on our services.Example ""sharing"" For example, with Google+, you have many different sharing options.Example ""sharing with others quicker and easier"" For example, if someone is already a contact, Google will autocomplete their name if you want to add them to a message in Gmail.Example ""We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly"" When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide very useful information about particular trends at that time."
